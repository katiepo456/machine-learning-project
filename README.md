# Champlain Alumni Salary Prediction

## Overview
This project is a statistical analysis of post-graduation career salaries for Champlain College alumni.

The model uses two different machine learning algorithms:
1. Linear regression
2. Random forest

The goal of this project is to analyze how much Champlain grads make at their first jobs out of college and to determine
which factors are the best predictors of salary. We hope the school's career services can make use of our findings.

All points in the original dataset were collected by the Champlain College Career Collaborative. Every year, the college
sends out an "exit survey" to all Champlain alumni who graduated the year prior. This survey collects detailed data such
as major, current employment status, annual salary, number of internships completed while attending college, and
cumulative GPA. The oldest data is from the graduating class of 2016 and the most recent data is from the graduating
class of 2023.

All data was anonymized by Champlain College administration before being distributed to us (all 
potentially identifying information was removed from the set).
